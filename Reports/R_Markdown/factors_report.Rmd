# How do WeRateDogs rates dogs?

<a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://twitter.com/dog_rates" target="_blank">**WeRateDogs**</a> is a Twitter account that asks people to send photos of their dogs, then tweets on selected photos, gives rating and a humorous comment. Dogs are rated on a scale of one to ten, but are invariably given ratings in excess of the maximum, such as 13/10, 14/10., etc. Why? Because,

Popular posts are re-posted on Instagram and Facebook. But, how do we measure whether a post is popular or not? Here comes the two notable features,

> * <font size="3">Re-tweet Count
> * Favorite Count</font>

WeRateDogs team receives 800 to 1,000 submissions daily and they work to narrow them down to about one high-quality piece of dog content per day. What are the factors that these tweets may get higher Re-tweet & Favorite Count <a class="fa fa-paw"></a>

# Various Factors

## 1. Rating

### Breeds with Highest Rating

The following graph shows the **top rated** breeds on average, which have been tweeted 14 times at least.

<center>

![](Images/rating_circular.jpg){width=70%}

</center>

> * <font size="3">Noticable top 5 rated breeds are, **Samoyed, Golden Retriever, Great Pyrenees, Pembroke, and Chow** in order</font>

### Is Samoyed Super-WOW <i class="fa fa-paw"></i>

Does the breed with highest rating is most likely to have highest Re-tweet and Favorite Count? To find this, the following Heat Map Visualization helps to check the correlation between Rating, Re-tweet and Favorite Count.

</center>

> * <font size="3">The correlation between Rating and either of Re-tweet or Favorite Count is very low</font>

So, the chances of other breed being Re-tweeted and Favored most is high.

### Here comes the WOW breed

Let's check on average Re-tweet and Favorite Count for top 15 breed. The breed being re-tweeted and favored most on average is considered as <font style="font-family: times, serif; font-style:italic,bold">[WOW](#wow)</font> breed. 

![](Images/retweet.jpg)

In order to avoid the chance of outliers, I have calculated average re-tweet and favorite count for the breeds, which have been tweeted 14 times at least. Among them, top 15 breed is shown in the  above graph. <br><br>


<div class='col2'>

<a id="wow" class="fa fa-paw" style="font-size:30px"></a>

<center><font size="5" style="font-family: times, serif; font-style:italic;justify-content: center;align-items: center">Here, comes the <br> **[Super WOW - French Bulldog](#wow)** <br> with highest average Re-tweet Count (4585) and average Favorite Count (18083) approximately.</font>

</div>

> * <font size="3">Therefore, **Rating** is **very less likely** to impact **Re-tweet and Favorite Count**</font>

## 2. Stages of Dog
### Different Stages of Dog

The Dogtionary explains the various stages of dog: doggo, pupper, puppo, and floof(er) (via the [#WeRateDogs book](https://www.amazon.com/WeRateDogs-Most-Hilarious-Adorable-Youve/dp/1510717145) on Amazon)

<br>

I have analyzed whether the various stages of dog with at least 10 tweets each, impacts the re-tweet & favorite count on average. 

<br>

</center>

> * <font size="3">It is evident that **Stages** do impact the **Re-tweet and Favorite Count** on average, where as favored count had an greater impact</font>

## 3. Hashtags
### Do Hashtag increase popularity?

Generally, hashtags do have a greater impact in popularity. Some of the commonly used hashtags by WeRateDogs are, #BarkWeek, #notallpuppers, #dogsatpollingstations, etc.,

The following graphical image shows the average re-tweet and favorite count based on hashtag added in the tweets.

> * <font size="3">Hashtag has increased the popularity to a greater extent. There is a drastic change in **Favorite Count** on average</font>

## 4. Day of the Week

How does the tweeted day of the week spreads out the Re-tweet & Favorite Count?

<br>

<center>

![](Images/dayweek.jpg){width=50%}

</center>

> * <font size="3">**Retweet and Favorite Count on average** increases gradually from **Monday** - **Wednesday**
> * Sudden drop in **Retweet and Favorite Count** in **Mid-Week (Thursday)** on average</font>
> * <font size="3">Gradually increases again before slight drop on **Sunday**</font>

## 5. Relationship between Re-tweets & Favorites

Typically, more the re-tweet more the favorites and vice verse. The graphical representation shows the **strong** relationship between re-tweets and favorites.

## Conclusion

The factors that greatly impacts the Re-tweets and Favorites are,

> * <font size="3">Breed
> * Stages of Dog</font>
